      <p>
        i‚Äôm an aspiring product designer with a love for creating intuitive,
        user-friendly web apps. my design journey started during my sophomore
        year, when i joined the design team for my college‚Äôs annual hackathon,
        fullyhacks 2024. that experience sparked my interest in crafting
        interfaces that not only look good, but feel seamless to use.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        i‚Äôve always been drawn to art, and design has become one of my favorite
        ways to express creativity. over time, i began exploring the world of
        designathons, where i collaborated with other designers to build
        projects in under 24 hours. i‚Äôve participated in events like createsc
        2024 (usc), gator user design 2024 (uf), and vista 2024 (ucla). at
        createsc, which was only my second designathon, my team and i made it to
        the top 15 finalists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        inspired by that experience, my friends and i decided to organize our
        own: fullybeyond 2024, the first designathon hosted by a csu. with my
        background in frontend development, i led the website‚Äôs development.
        after six months of planning, we successfully launched the event and
        received 100+ applicants. it was one of the most meaningful moments of
        my college experience, and it reminded me how much i love working with
        others to bring ideas to life. i‚Äôm now interning as a user experience researcher
        at lpl financial in san diego to explore how user insights can shape stronger, 
        more meaningful designs. my goal is to keep building experiences that truly connect.
